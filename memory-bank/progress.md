# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

* **I. Overall Project Health:** Yellow - Significant refactoring of the messaging system (Phase 1) is complete. Core backend logic for group chat, participant management, admin approval flows, and notifications is in place. Attachment storage paths updated. Requires thorough testing and Phase 2 (UI, further refinements).
* **Current Phase:** Completion of Messaging System Refactor (Phase 1).
* **Percentage Completion (Estimate):** 42% (Adjusted for messaging system refactor Phase 1 completion).

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed This Session - Messaging System Refactor - Phase 1):**
    * **Database:** Migration created and run to remove `participant1_id`, `participant2_id` from `conversations` table, shifting reliance to `conversation_user` pivot table for group chat.
    * **Models:** `app/Models/Conversation.php` refactored to use `participants()` relationship; methods like `scopeForUser`, `unreadCount`, `isParticipant` updated. `markAsReadForUser` added.
    * **Controllers:**
        * `app/Http/Controllers/Client/MessageController.php`: Updated for group chat logic (authorization, participant loading, message creation). Dispatches `ClientMessageSent` event. Attachment storage path updated to `ArchiAxis/Job_X/chat_thread/`.
        * `app/Http/Controllers/Freelancer/MessageController.php`: Updated for group chat logic. Freelancer messages set to `pending_review`. Attachment storage path updated. Participant syncing in `create()` method.
        * `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MessageController.php`: Updated for group chat logic. Admin messages auto-approved. Dispatches `AdminMessageSent` event. Attachment storage path updated.
    * **Events, Listeners, Notifications:**
        * `ClientMessageSent` event &rarr; `NotifyParticipantsOfClientMessage` listener &rarr; `NewMessageFromClientNotification`.
        * `AdminMessageSent` event &rarr; `NotifyParticipantsOfAdminMessage` listener &rarr; `NewMessageFromAdminNotification`.
        * `MessageApprovedByAdmin` event (existing) &rarr; `NotifyParticipantsOfApprovedMessage` listener (refactored) &rarr; `NewApprovedMessageInConversationNotification` (for other participants) AND `YourMessageWasApprovedNotification` (for original sender).
        * All relevant events/listeners registered in `EventServiceProvider`.
    * **Participant Syncing on Assignment:**
        * `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/JobApplicationController.php` (`updateStatus`): When application accepted, syncs client, freelancer, and all admins to the assignment's conversation.
        * `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/JobAssignmentController.php` (`store`): When new assignment created, syncs client, freelancer, and all admins to the assignment's conversation.
    * **Outcome:** Backend foundation for group messaging is established. Notifications for client, admin, and approved freelancer messages are implemented. Attachment paths in controllers have been updated.
* **(Previous features listed in older `progress.md` versions remain relevant).**

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

* **For Enhanced Messaging System (Phase 2 & Refinements):**
    * **Attachment Storage Path Verification & URL Generation:**
        * Confirm `store($storagePath, 'public')` correctly creates/uses `public/storage/ArchiAxis/Job_X/chat_thread/` directory structure.
        * Ensure public symlink (`php artisan storage:link`) is effective for these paths.
        * Verify/update `FileHelper` or other mechanisms for generating accessible URLs for these attachments in views.
    * **UI Enhancements:** WhatsApp styling, Emojis.
    * **Participant Management Review:**
        * Review conversation creation points (e.g., when a client posts a job, should a conversation be auto-created with admins?).
        * Admin roles in conversations: Current logic adds *all* admins to some conversations. Refine if needed.
* **Remaining from Job Application System:**
    * Update action URLs in notifications if new specific views are created.
    * Thorough testing of the 'accepted_for_assignment' flow.
* **Broader Pending Tasks:** (As listed in previous `progress.md`)

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

* **Notification Links:** TODOs remain for some action URLs in notifications.
* **Tooling:** `replace_in_file` and `write_to_file` tools showed instability during this session.
* **(Refer to `activeContext.md` for a more comprehensive list of older known issues if still relevant).**

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

* **5/23/2025 (Messaging System Refactor - Phase 1):**
    * **Decision:** Overhauled the conversation system for group chat capabilities, including comprehensive notification flows for different message types and admin moderation for freelancer messages. Updated attachment storage paths.
    * **Impact:** Enables the new messaging workflow as per user requirements. This was a substantial backend refactor.
* **(Previous decisions documented in `activeContext.md` and older `progress.md` versions remain relevant).**

*This document provides a snapshot of the project's progress and should be updated regularly.*
