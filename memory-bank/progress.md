# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

*   **Overall Project Health:** Red - Admin user creation functionality was previously blocked by a 500 error (related to `User::ROLES`). While admin activity logging for user creation has been implemented, the underlying user creation success is still dependent on resolving this error.
*   **Current Phase:** Early Development - Core feature implementation and ongoing debugging.
*   **Percentage Completion (Estimate):** 7% (Admin activity logging foundational work complete)

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

*   **As of 5/20/2025:**
    *   Memory Bank: Structure established and actively maintained.
    *   Basic Laravel Setup:
        *   Routing structure in place (and now free of syntax errors)
        *   MVC architecture implemented
        *   Authentication system partially implemented
        *   Admin, Client, and Freelancer roles defined
    *   Code Structure:
        *   `User::ROLES` constant correctly defined in `app/Models/User.php`
        *   Admin user creation code (Controller, Routes, View) appears logically sound
        *   Cache clearing functionality verified (all commands execute successfully)
    *   **Admin Activity Logging (Initial Implementation):**
        *   `admin_activity_logs` table and `AdminActivityLog` model created.
        *   `UserCreatedByAdmin` event and `LogAdminActivity` listener implemented to record when an admin creates a user.
        *   Admin dashboard updated to display recent admin activities.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

*   **Critical Fixes Needed:**
    *   Resolve admin user creation 500 error
    *   Investigate potential autoloading or file system issues
*   **Core Platform Features:**
    *   User Registration (Client, Freelancer)
    *   User Login & Authentication
        *   Admin login functionality (currently affected by errors)
        *   Client/Freelancer login flows
    *   User Profiles (Client, Freelancer)
    *   Job Posting (Client)
    *   Job Browsing/Searching (Freelancer)
    *   Proposal Submission (Freelancer)
    *   Proposal Review & Awarding (Client)
    *   Basic Messaging System
    *   Admin Dashboard (Partially implemented: basic stats, recent jobs, initial activity log)
    *   Expand admin activity logging to cover more admin actions.
*   **Future Phases:**
    *   Payment Integration
    *   Advanced Search/Filtering
    *   Notifications System
    *   Dispute Resolution System
    *   Ratings & Reviews

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

*   **As of 5/20/2025:**
    *   **500 Error on Admin Add User:**
        *   Error persists despite thorough cache clearing
        *   Error message indicates `User::ROLES` constant is undefined
        *   Verified constant exists in `User.php`
        *   All Laravel caches cleared successfully
        *   PHP Opcache reset attempted
        *   Issue may be related to autoloading or file system
    *   **Cache-Related Findings:**
        *   Laravel cache clearing commands all execute successfully
        *   Cache clearing does not resolve the 500 error
        *   Suggests deeper issue than cache staleness
    *   **Development Environment Limitations:**
        *   cPanel Terminal not available
        *   Limited ability to run commands like `composer dump-autoload`
    *   **Previous Issues (Resolved):**
        *   ~~Duplicate `use` statement in `routes/web.php`~~ (Fixed)
        *   ~~Missing `User::ROLES` constant~~ (Verified present in code)

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

*   **5/20/2025 - Recent Development Session:**
    *   **Initial Approach:** Attempted to resolve 500 error by clearing all caches
        *   Created temporary route for cache clearing
        *   Successfully cleared all Laravel caches
        *   Reset PHP's Opcache
        *   Error persisted despite cache clearing
    *   **Route File Cleanup:**
        *   Identified and fixed duplicate `use` statement in `routes/web.php`
        *   Removed temporary cache-clearing route after testing
    *   **Current Direction:**
        *   Investigating deeper system issues:
            *   Potential autoloader problems
            *   File system access/propagation delays
            *   Additional caching layers
            *   File encoding or invisible character issues
    *   **Learning Points:**
        *   Cache clearing success doesn't guarantee resolution
        *   Multiple caching layers exist and interact
        *   Shared hosting environment may have additional complexities
*   **5/20/2025 - Admin Activity Logging Implementation:**
    *   **Feature Added:** Implemented a system to log admin activities.
        *   Created `AdminActivityLog` model and migration.
        *   Established an event (`UserCreatedByAdmin`) and a generic listener (`LogAdminActivity`) for logging.
        *   Integrated logging into the admin user creation process.
        *   Updated the admin dashboard to display these logs.
    *   **Decision:** Focused on user creation as the first logged admin action, with plans to expand.
    *   **Consideration:** The effectiveness of logging user creation depends on the successful resolution of the pre-existing `User::ROLES` error during user creation.
