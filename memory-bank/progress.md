# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

* **I. Overall Project Health:** Yellow - Core functionalities for multi-stage work submission largely in place. Significant progress made on standardizing the application's UI with a new light theme (Admin, Client, Freelancer views). Some listener implementations were previously hindered by tool issues, but file modification tools are currently stable.
* **Current Phase:** Application-Wide UI Theming & Documentation; Feature Development (Work Submission & Review Flow - final touches and testing).
* **Percentage Completion (Estimate):** 20% (Factoring in submission flow, UI theming of key admin pages (initial application), and documentation updates).

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

* **As of 5/22/2025 (Current Session - Latest Updates):**
  * **Freelancer Messages UI Update:**
    * `resources/views/freelancer/messages/index.blade.php` updated to use a table layout similar to the admin's message view, improving UI consistency. Applied standard light theme styling.
  * **Admin Dashboard "Recent Jobs" Update:**
    * `AdminDashboardController.php` updated to fetch jobs based on actual statuses found in the database (`'open', 'approved', 'submitted', 'in_progress', 'completed'`).
    * `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php` updated to display these jobs in a single, scrollable list.
    * 'Active Projects' summary count updated to use relevant statuses.
  * **MCP Server for MySQL Querying:**
    * Successfully created and configured a new MCP server (`mysql-query-server`) located at `C:\Users\Raidmax i5\Documents\Cline\MCP\mysql-query-server`.
    * The server provides an `execute_mysql_query` tool.
    * Configuration added to `c:\Users\Raidmax i5\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json` with necessary DB credentials.
    * Used the new tool to identify actual job statuses in the database.
  * **Route Fix (Earlier this session):** Resolved `RouteNotFoundException` for `admin.job-assignments.tasks.edit`.
  * **Standard UI Theming (Earlier this session & Current):**
    * Applied to `admin/jobs/assignments/show.blade.php` and `admin/jobs/index.blade.php`.
    * Applied to `freelancer/jobs/show.blade.php` (updated to use `x-layouts.freelancer`, fixed description HTML rendering).
    * Applied to `layouts/app.blade.php` and `layouts/navigation.blade.php` (removed dark theme classes).
  * **Multi-Stage Work Submission & Review Flow (Earlier this session):** Core logic and UI structure implemented.
* **Previous Features (Verified or Addressed in Prior Sessions):**
  * Bug Fixes on Admin Task Edit Page (before current theming).
  * Initial (dark) Theming Consistency in Admin Assignments & Tasks.
  * UI Updates on Admin Job Details Page (Proposals tab merged, comment form added).
  * Backend for general Admin Comments on Jobs.
  * Database schema update for `budget` column precision.
  * General Admin Job Section Theming.
  * Admin Activity Logging (initial).
  * Queue Configuration.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

* **Immediate (Blocked by Tool Issues / Needs Implementation):**
  * **Listener Implementation:**
    * Successfully write the full logic for `app/Listeners/NotifyAdminAndFreelancerOfClientComment.php`.
    * Register this listener in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` for the `JobCommentCreated` event.
  * **Notification Classes:**
    * Create `ClientCommentNotificationToAdmin` and `ClientCommentNotificationToFreelancer` (and any other required notification classes for the review flow).
    * Define content and channels (email, database) for these notifications.
* **Further Implementation & Verification for Current Feature:**
  * **Client File Download:** Implement or verify a secure, client-accessible route for downloading work submission files from `resources/views/client/work-submissions/show.blade.php`.
  * **Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the entire submission and review workflow across Freelancer, Admin, and Client roles.
  * **Linter/Runtime Errors:** Investigate and resolve any persistent linter errors (e.g., `Storage::download`, `auth()->id()`) if they cause runtime issues.
  * **Bug Fix (Current):** Resolved `RelationNotFoundException` for `conversations` on `JobAssignment` model by adding the relationship method in `app/Models/JobAssignment.php`. This was affecting the freelancer's assignment detail view.
* **Application UI Theming (Site-Wide):**
  * Apply the new standard light theme to remaining Admin, Client, and Freelancer pages (e.g., user management, reports, settings, client dashboard, freelancer job browse, etc.) for consistency.
  * Review and potentially adjust the `x-status-badge` component to better match the solid-background badge style shown in some reference images, or implement custom badge styling where needed.
* **Broader Pending Tasks (from `projectbrief.md` / `productContext.md` / previous sessions):**
  * User Registration (Client, Freelancer)
  * User Login & Authentication
  * User Profiles (Client, Freelancer)
  * Job Posting (Client) & Browsing (Freelancer)
  * Proposal System (beyond what's integrated into admin job show)
  * Full Messaging System
  * Expand Admin Activity Logging
  * Payment Integration, Advanced Search, Ratings & Reviews.
* **User Verification Pending (from previous work):**
  * Numerous UI theming changes and bug fixes from before the current task.

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

* **Tooling:** File modification tools have been stable. MCP server creation process was successful.
* **Linter Warnings (from previous work, may still be relevant):**
  * `AdminWorkSubmissionController.php`: `Undefined method 'download'` for `Storage::disk('private')->download(...)`.
  * `ClientWorkSubmissionController.php`: `Undefined method 'id'` for `auth()->id()`.
* **Placeholder Route (from previous work):** Client work submission download link in `client/work-submissions/show.blade.php`.
* **Status Badge Styling (from previous work):** `x-status-badge` component may need adjustments.
* **RESOLVED (This Session):** `RelationNotFoundException` for `conversations` on `JobAssignment` model.
* **RESOLVED (This Session):** Admin dashboard not showing all relevant jobs / using incorrect statuses.
* **Potentially Still Active (from previous sessions):**
  * 500 Error on Admin Add User (`User::ROLES` issue) - needs re-testing.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

* **5/22/2025 (Current Task): Admin Dashboard Job Display & MCP Server for MySQL**
  * **Decision:** To accurately display jobs on the admin dashboard, a new MCP server (`mysql-query-server`) was created to allow direct introspection of the MySQL database to determine the actual job statuses in use.
  * **Impact:** The `AdminDashboardController` now uses the precise list of statuses (`'open', 'approved', 'submitted', 'in_progress', 'completed'`) obtained from the database. The dashboard view (`resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`) displays all jobs matching these statuses in a single scrollable list. The 'Active Projects' count was also updated. The new MCP server is configured and operational.
* **5/22/2025 (Earlier This Session & Current): Application-Wide UI Theming Standardization**
  * **Decision:** Adopted and began implementing a standardized light theme.
  * **Impact:** Applied to Admin Job Index, Assignment Details, Freelancer Job Details (including layout update for sidebar and description fix), and general application layout/navigation. Documented in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`.
* **5/21/2025 (Earlier This Session): Multi-Stage Work Submission & Review Flow**
  * **Decision:** Implemented a comprehensive review cycle.
  * **Impact:** Database, Model, Controller, View, and Event changes as detailed in `activeContext.md`.
* **Previous decisions documented in `activeContext.md` remain relevant for prior work.**

*This document provides a snapshot of the project's progress and should be updated regularly. It links back to `activeContext.md` for current work and `projectbrief.md` / `productContext.md` for overall goals.*
