# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

* **I. Overall Project Health:** Green - Core functionality for freelancer job application submission, admin viewing, and status update notifications for freelancers are in place.
* **Current Phase:** Phase 1 of Admin Job Application Management (Listing, Viewing, Status Update & Notification) completed.
* **Percentage Completion (Estimate):** 36% (Adjusted for completed Job Application Status Update Notification items).

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed This Session - Job Application Status Update Notifications):**
    * **Event:** Created `app/Events/JobApplicationStatusUpdated.php` event, which accepts the `JobApplication` and the `oldStatus`.
    * **Notification Class:** Created `app/Notifications/JobApplicationStatusUpdatedNotification.php` for database and mail channels, to inform freelancers about changes to their application status.
    * **Listener:** Created `app/Listeners/NotifyFreelancerOfApplicationStatusUpdate.php` to handle the `JobApplicationStatusUpdated` event and send the notification to the relevant freelancer.
    * **Controller Update:** Modified `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/JobApplicationController.php`'s `updateStatus` method to dispatch the `JobApplicationStatusUpdated` event after saving the status change.
    * **Service Provider:** Registered the new event and listener in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`.
    * **Outcome:** When an admin updates the status of a job application, the freelancer who submitted the application will receive a notification about this change.
* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed This Session - Admin Job Application Management - Phase 1: Listing & Viewing):**
    * (Details in previous `progress.md` version - Admin routes, controller, views, sidebar link for job applications).
    * **Outcome:** Admins can list, view, and update status for job applications.
* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed This Session - Freelancer Job Application System - Phase 1: Submission):**
    * (Details in previous `progress.md` version - Database, Model, Controller, Form Request, Event, Listener, Notification, Routes, Views for freelancer submission).
    * **Outcome:** Freelancers can submit applications for jobs posted to them. Admins are notified.
* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed This Session - Notification Logic for `JobPostedToFreelancers`):**
    * (Details in previous `progress.md` version - Notification class, Listener update, Layout update).
    * **Outcome:** Freelancers receive notifications for jobs posted to them; UI shows unread counts.
* **As of 5/23/2025 (Completed Earlier This Session - Admin Job Management & Current Jobs Page):**
    * (Details in previous `progress.md` version).

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

* **Immediate (For Job Application System - Phase 2 & Admin Management Refinement):**
    * Develop UI for Clients (job posters) to view applications if the workflow requires their involvement in selection.
    * Implement filters on the admin job applications index page (`resources/views/admin/job-applications/index.blade.php`).
    * Implement the TODO for notifying the client in `app/Listeners/NotifyAdminOfJobApplication.php`.
    * Update action URLs in `app/Notifications/NewJobApplicationNotification.php` and `app/Notifications/JobApplicationStatusUpdatedNotification.php` once relevant admin/client/freelancer views for applications/assignments are finalized.
* **For Admin Job Assignment & Posting Feature (Remaining from previous):**
    * Integrate the "Job Application" system with "Job Assignment". If an application status is set to 'accepted_for_assignment', this should likely trigger the creation or update of a `JobAssignment`.
    * Clarify/merge "Proposals" vs. "Applications".
* **Broader Pending Tasks:** (As listed in previous `progress.md`)

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

* **Notifications for Client (Job Application):** The `NotifyAdminOfJobApplication` listener has a TODO to implement logic for notifying the client who posted the job.
* **Notification Links (Job Application & Status Update):** The notification classes have TODOs for action URLs.
* **Tooling:** `replace_in_file` and `write_to_file` tools showed instability during this session.
* **(Refer to `activeContext.md` for a more comprehensive list of older known issues if still relevant).**

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

* **5/23/2025 (Job Application Status Update Notifications):**
    * **Decision:** Implemented an event-driven system to notify freelancers when an admin changes the status of their job application.
    * **Impact:** Improves communication with freelancers regarding their application progress.
