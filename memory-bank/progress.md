# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

* **Overall Project Health:** Yellow - A significant "Internal Server Error" related to the database queue has been addressed by reconfiguring the queue table and providing a new migration. The fix requires user action (running `php artisan migrate`). The previous admin user creation 500 error (related to `User::ROLES`) is still a concern and needs re-testing after this queue issue is confirmed resolved.
* **Current Phase:** Early Development - Core feature implementation and ongoing debugging.
* **Percentage Completion (Estimate):** 8% (Queue table issue addressed, pending migration by user).

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

* **As of 5/20/2025 (Evening):**
  * Memory Bank: Structure established and actively maintained.
  * Basic Laravel Setup:
    * Routing structure in place.
    * MVC architecture implemented.
    * Authentication system partially implemented.
    * Admin, Client, and Freelancer roles defined.
  * Code Structure:
    * `User::ROLES` constant correctly defined in `app/Models/User.php`.
    * Admin user creation code (Controller, Routes, View) appears logically sound.
  * **Admin Activity Logging (Initial Implementation):**
    * `admin_activity_logs` table and `AdminActivityLog` model created.
    * `UserCreatedByAdmin` event and `LogAdminActivity` listener implemented.
    * Admin dashboard updated to display recent admin activities.
  * **Queue Configuration:**
    * `config/queue.php` updated to use `queue_jobs` as the default table name for the database queue driver, resolving a conflict with the application's `jobs` table.
    * New migration `2025_05_20_200000_create_queue_jobs_table.php` created with the correct schema for Laravel's database queue.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

* **Immediate User Action:**
  * Admin job creation and freelancer assignment workflow, including initial freelancer notification logic, has been successfully debugged and verified.
* **Critical Fixes Needed (Post-Testing):**
  * Re-test admin user creation to see if the `User::ROLES` 500 error (previously encountered) persists or was indirectly related to other issues.
  * Investigate potential autoloading or file system issues if errors continue.
* **Core Platform Features:**
  * User Registration (Client, Freelancer)
  * User Login & Authentication
    * Admin login functionality
    * Client/Freelancer login flows
  * User Profiles (Client, Freelancer)
  * Job Posting (Client)
  * Job Browsing/Searching (Freelancer)
  * Proposal Submission (Freelancer)
  * Proposal Review & Awarding (Client)
  * Basic Messaging System
  * Admin Dashboard (Partially implemented)
  * Expand admin activity logging.
* **Future Phases:**
  * Payment Integration, Advanced Search, Notifications, Dispute Resolution, Ratings & Reviews.

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

* **As of 5/21/2025 (Early Morning):**
  * **Currency Display:** Updated admin jobs list to use `CurrencyHelper::formatZAR()`. (Pending user verification)
  * **Admin Job Creation Logging:** Configured `AdminJobPosted` event and `LogAdminActivity` listener to log when an admin creates a job. (Pending user verification)
  * **Admin Job Creation & Assignment Flow:** Successfully debugged and verified. This involved fixing:
    * Queue table configuration (`queue_jobs`).
    * `createdByAdmin` relationship on `Job` model.
    * `comments` relationship on `Job` model.
    * `timeLogs` relationship on `JobAssignment` model (changed to `HasManyThrough`).
    * `admin.jobs.destroy` route definition.
    * Routes and controller logic for job assignment creation and redirects (including `JobAssignmentController@show` and `edit` methods, and Blade views for assignment show/edit).
  * **Freelancer Notification:** Logic for notifying freelancers upon assignment (email and DB) is in place and correctly configured.
  * **500 Error on Admin Add User (Potentially Still Active):**
    * Error message indicated `User::ROLES` constant is undefined. This needs re-testing now that other major issues are resolved.
    * Verified constant exists in `User.php`.
    * Issue may be related to autoloading or file system.
  * **Development Environment Limitations:**
    * cPanel Terminal not available for direct Artisan command execution by Cline.
  * **Previous Issues (Resolved):**
    * ~~Duplicate `use` statement in `routes/web.php`~~
    * ~~"Unknown column 'queue' in 'INSERT INTO' for jobs table"~~
    * ~~`RelationNotFoundException` for `createdByAdmin` on `Job` model~~
    * ~~`RelationNotFoundException` for `comments` on `Job` model~~
    * ~~`RouteNotFoundException` for `admin.jobs.destroy`~~
    * ~~`RouteNotFoundException` for `admin.jobs.assignments.store` (Blade view)~~
    * ~~`UrlGenerationException` (Missing $job parameter) for `admin.jobs.show` in `JobAssignmentController@create` view.~~
    * ~~`RouteNotFoundException` for `admin.jobs.assignments.index` (Controller redirect)~~
    * ~~TODO comments in `JobAssignmentController`~~
    * ~~`UrlGenerationException` for `admin.jobs.show` in `assignments/show.blade.php` (Back to Job Details link)~~
    * ~~`UrlGenerationException` for `admin.job-assignments.edit` in `assignments/show.blade.php` (Edit Assignment link)~~
    * ~~`UrlGenerationException` for `admin.jobs.show` in `JobAssignmentController@update` redirect~~

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

* **5/21/2025 (Early Morning) - Currency and Activity Log Fixes:**
  * Updated `admin/jobs/index.blade.php` to use `CurrencyHelper` for ZAR formatting.
  * Modified `AdminJobPosted` event and `EventServiceProvider` to enable logging of admin job creation via `LogAdminActivity`.
* **5/21/2025 (Early Morning) - Job Assignment Flow & Notification Verification (Continued):**
  * Corrected `timeLogs` relationship in `JobAssignment` model to `HasManyThrough`.
  * Made `JobAssignmentController@show` and `edit` methods explicitly fetch `JobAssignment` to resolve issues with route model binding and subsequent relationship loading.
  * Updated `assignments/show.blade.php` and `assignments/edit.blade.php` to handle potentially null job relationships more gracefully and correct route names.
  * Confirmed the entire admin job creation and freelancer assignment process is working.
  * Verified that the `JobAssigned` event correctly triggers the `SendFreelancerAssignmentNotification` listener.
  * Removed TODO comments from `JobAssignmentController`.
  * Corrected redirects in `JobAssignmentController` to point to `admin.jobs.show`.
  * Adjusted `JobAssignmentController@create` to fetch `Job` via `job_id` query parameter.
  * Fixed `admin.jobs.assignments.create` blade view.
  * Added `comments` relationship to `Job` model.
  * Added `destroy` action to `admin.jobs` resource route.
* **5/20/2025 (Very Late Evening) - Addressing `RelationNotFoundException` for `createdByAdmin`:**
  * Added `createdByAdmin` relationship and `created_by_admin_id` to `fillable` in `app/Models/Job.php`.
* **5/20/2025 (Late Evening) - Queue Table Conflict Resolution Steps:**
  * User ensured `.env` file was correct regarding `DB_QUEUE_TABLE`.
  * User executed `php artisan config:clear`.
  * User executed `php artisan migrate` (reported "Nothing to migrate").
* **5/20/2025 - Queue Table Conflict Resolution (Initial Fix by Cline):**
  * **Problem:** The application's `jobs` table (for job listings) conflicted with the default table name (`jobs`) used by Laravel's database queue driver. The original migration for the queue's `jobs` table had been repurposed.
  * **Solution (by Cline):**
        1. Modified `config/queue.php` to change the default table name for the database queue to `queue_jobs`.
        2. Created a new migration file (`2025_05_20_200000_create_queue_jobs_table.php`) with the standard Laravel schema for this `queue_jobs` table.
  * **Decision Rationale:** Reconfiguring the queue table name was chosen over renaming the application's main `jobs` table and model to minimize disruption.
* **5/20/2025 - Admin Activity Logging Implementation:**
  * Feature added to log admin activities, starting with user creation.
* **Previous (5/20/2025 - Cache and `User::ROLES` issue):**
  * Extensive cache clearing did not resolve the `User::ROLES` error.
  * Route file cleanup performed.
