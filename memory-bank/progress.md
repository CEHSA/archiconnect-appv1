# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status Summary

*   **Overall Project Health:** Yellow - Admin login is failing, and a 500 error is reported when adding users. These issues are likely related to database connectivity/configuration.
*   **Current Phase (if applicable, from `projectbrief.md`):**
    *   Example: Phase 1: Core platform development.
*   **Percentage Completion (Estimate - very rough):**
    *   Example: 5% (Memory Bank initialized, initial debugging session for critical errors)

## 2. What Works (Implemented Features)

*   **(List features or components that are implemented and considered functional.)**
*   **As of [Current Date]:**
    *   Memory Bank: Initial structure and core files created and updated.
    *   `User::ROLES` constant confirmed to be correctly defined in `app/Models/User.php`.
    *   Admin user creation code (Controller, Routes, View) appears logically sound.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Key Pending Features)

*   **(List major features or user stories from `productContext.md` that are not yet started or are in progress.)**
*   **Core Platform:**
    *   User Registration (Client, Freelancer)
    *   User Login & Authentication (Admin login currently failing, needs resolution)
    *   User Profiles (Client, Freelancer)
    *   Job Posting (Client)
    *   Job Browsing/Searching (Freelancer)
    *   Proposal Submission (Freelancer)
    *   Proposal Review & Awarding (Client)
    *   Basic Messaging System
    *   Admin Dashboard (Basic - User add/edit functionality is part of this, currently impacted by errors)
*   **Future Phases (from `projectbrief.md`):**
    *   Payment Integration
    *   Advanced Search/Filtering
    *   Notifications System (Email, In-app)
    *   Dispute Resolution System
    *   Ratings & Reviews

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

*   **(List any known bugs, technical debt, or issues that need addressing.)**
*   **As of 5/20/2025:**
    *   **Admin Login Failure:** Unable to log in to the admin panel using provided or pre-filled credentials.
    *   **500 Error on Admin Add User:** User reports a 500 error when attempting to add a new user via the admin panel. This could not be directly reproduced due to login failures.
    *   **Suspected Database Issue:** Both login failure (with `SESSION_DRIVER=database`) and the reported 500 error strongly point to underlying database connectivity, configuration, or schema (e.g., `sessions` table) problems.
    *   **Laravel Logging Not Working:** `storage/logs/laravel.log` is not being created/found, hindering direct error diagnosis via Laravel logs.
    *   ~~Admin 'edit users' function is not working due to a missing `User::ROLES` constant in the `User` model.~~ (This was a previous understanding; `User::ROLES` is confirmed present. The edit user issue might also be linked to the broader database problem if it persists).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Scope

*   **(Track significant changes to scope, priorities, or technical decisions over time.)**
*   **[Date] - Initial Setup:**
    *   Decision: Initialize Memory Bank as per custom instructions.
    *   Scope: Core Memory Bank files created.
*   **5/20/2025 - Debugging Admin User Add/Login:**
    *   Initial focus: 500 error on adding a user.
    *   Expanded focus: Admin login failures encountered during attempts to reproduce the 500 error.
    *   Investigation path: Checked logs (unsuccessful), reviewed code (routes, controller, model, view for user creation), attempted to use `db-check.php` script (unsuccessful).
    *   Current hypothesis: Root cause is likely database-related, affecting both sessions (login) and data manipulation (user creation).
    *   Decision: Recommended user investigate database server status, credentials, table schemas (especially `sessions`), and DB user permissions. Also recommended checking web server error logs.
