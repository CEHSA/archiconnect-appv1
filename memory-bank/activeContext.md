# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

* **What is the immediate task or feature being worked on?**
  * Investigating a 500 server error when an admin tries to add a new user. This also involved investigating admin login failures.
* **Specific Goals for this Session:**
  * Identify the cause of the 500 error.
  * Attempt to log in to the admin panel to reproduce the error.
  * Provide recommendations based on findings.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

* **What significant changes were made recently?**
  * Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in `.env.production` to attempt to capture more detailed logs (later reverted to `error`).
  * Attempted to log in to admin panel via browser multiple times; all attempts failed.
  * Attempted to access `db-check.php` script, which resulted in a 404.
  * Reviewed relevant code (routes, `Admin\UserController`, `User` model, `admin.users.create` view).
* **Key decisions made during the last session:**
  * Concluded that the primary code for user creation appears correct.
  * Hypothesized that the issue is likely related to database connectivity or configuration, especially since `SESSION_DRIVER=database` and login is also failing.
  * Decided to recommend database and server-level checks to the user.

## 3. Next Steps & Pending Tasks

* **What are the immediate next steps based on the current focus?**
  * User to investigate database connectivity, credentials, table structures (especially `sessions` and `users`), and user permissions as per recommendations.
  * User to check web server error logs for more fundamental error messages.
* **Broader pending tasks from `projectbrief.md` or `productContext.md`:**
  * User Registration (Client, Freelancer)
  * User Login & Authentication (currently problematic for admin)
  * User Profiles (Client, Freelancer)
  * Admin Dashboard (Basic)

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

* **Are there any open questions or points needing clarification?**
  * The root cause of the login failure and the 500 error is not definitively pinpointed but is strongly suspected to be database-related.
* **Potential roadblocks or challenges anticipated?**
  * User may need database/server administration access to perform the recommended checks.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed or Stated)

* **Coding Style Preferences:**
  * (To be filled as observed)
* **Architectural Preferences:**
  * Standard Laravel MVC patterns are in use.
  * Use of Blade components for views.
  * Route-model binding is utilized.
  * Database-driven sessions.
* **Testing Preferences:**
  * (To be filled as observed)
* **Tooling/Workflow Preferences:**
  * (To be filled as observed)

## 6. Learnings & Insights from Current Work

* **What has been learned recently about the project, codebase, or tools?**
  * Admin login is currently failing.
  * Laravel log file (`storage/logs/laravel.log`) is not being generated or found, even with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` and config cache cleared.
  * The `User::ROLES` constant is correctly defined in the `User` model.
  * The `Admin\UserController` and associated view for creating users appear to be correctly implemented.
  * The application uses `SESSION_DRIVER=database`.
* **Any "Aha!" moments or important realizations?**
  * Persistent login failures combined with a database session driver strongly point to database issues as a root cause for wider application instability, including the 500 error on user creation.

*This document is the most dynamic and should be updated frequently, ideally at the beginning and end of each development session. It links information from `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to the immediate tasks at hand.*
