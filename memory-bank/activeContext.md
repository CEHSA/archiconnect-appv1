        *   Updated 'Active Projects' count in the dashboard stats.
    *   **MCP Server for MySQL (Current Task):**
        *   Created a new MCP server at `C:\Users\Raidmax i5\Documents\Cline\MCP\mysql-query-server`.
        *   Implemented `src/index.ts` for the server to provide an `execute_mysql_query` tool.
        *   Built the server using `npm run build`.
        *   Configured the server in `c:\Users\Raidmax i5\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json` with necessary environment variables for DB connection.
        *   Successfully tested the new tool to retrieve distinct job statuses.
    *   **Freelancer Messages UI Update (Current Task):**
        *   Modified `resources/views/freelancer/messages/index.blade.php` to use a table layout similar to the admin's message view, improving consistency.
        *   Applied standard light theme styling (green border, cyan buttons, consistent table headers).
    *   **Standard UI Theming Update (Earlier This Session & Current):**
        *   Re-themed `resources/views/admin/jobs/assignments/show.blade.php` and `resources/views/admin/jobs/index.blade.php`.
        *   Re-themed `resources/views/freelancer/jobs/show.blade.php`, changed its layout to `x-layouts.freelancer`, and fixed HTML rendering for the job description.
        *   Re-themed `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` and `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php` by removing dark theme classes.
*   **Key decisions made during this session:**
    *   **Freelancer Messages View:** Updated `resources/views/freelancer/messages/index.blade.php` to use a table layout for conversations, mirroring the admin section's style for better UI consistency.
    *   **Freelancer Job View Layout & Content:** Updated `resources/views/freelancer/jobs/show.blade.php` to use `x-layouts.freelancer` for consistency with the freelancer dashboard (including sidebar) and corrected job description rendering to display HTML instead of raw tags.
    *   **Admin Dashboard:** Fetch specific job statuses (`'open', 'approved', 'submitted', 'in_progress', 'completed'`) for the "Recent Jobs" section based on direct database introspection. Display as a single scrollable list.
    *   **MCP Server:** Created a dedicated MCP server for MySQL queries to aid in development and debugging, such as identifying actual data values (e.g., job statuses).
    *   Comments with screenshots will be handled by extending the existing `JobComment` system.
    *   A new set of status constants was defined for `WorkSubmission`.
    *   Admin and Client review actions are handled by updating `WorkSubmission` status.
    *   Events are dispatched at key transition points.
    *   Adopted a new light theme with teal/green accents as the standard.
    *   Resolved `RelationNotFoundException` for `conversations` on `JobAssignment` model.
*   **Tool Issues:** Earlier tool issues with file writing seem resolved. The new MCP server creation and configuration process was smooth.

## 3. Next Steps & Pending Tasks

*   **Immediate:**
    *   Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`) to reflect the admin dashboard changes and the new MCP server. (Current action)
*   **Previously Pending (Blocked by Tool Issues - if they resurface):**
    *   Successfully write the logic for `app/Listeners/NotifyAdminAndFreelancerOfClientComment.php`.
    *   Register the `NotifyAdminAndFreelancerOfClientComment` listener in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` for the `JobCommentCreated` event.
    *   Create Notification classes (e.g., `ClientCommentNotificationToAdmin`, `ClientCommentNotificationToFreelancer`) and their email/database templates.
*   **Further Implementation & Verification:**
    *   Verify/implement a client-accessible download route for work submission files (currently `admin.work-submissions.download` is used as a placeholder in the client view).
    *   Thoroughly test the entire multi-stage submission and review flow for freelancers, admins, and clients.
    *   Ensure notifications are correctly triggered and received.
    *   Address any linter issues that might persist or cause runtime errors (e.g., `Storage::download` in `AdminWorkSubmissionController`, `auth()->id()` in `ClientWorkSubmissionController`).
*   **Application UI Theming (Site-Wide):**
    *   Continue applying the new standard light theme (white cards, green border, teal/cyan accents) to other Admin, Client, and Freelancer pages as they are developed or refactored to ensure consistency.
*   **Broader pending tasks (from previous sessions):**
    *   User to verify fixes on Admin Task Edit page.
    *   Test admin user creation flow.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

*   **Tool Stability:** Monitor reliability of file modification tools.
*   **Notification Details:** Specific content and channels for notifications (email, database) for the new review flow need to be defined when implementing the notification classes.
*   **Client File Download:** Clarify if clients should use a separate download route or if the admin one is acceptable with current permissions.
*   **Status Badge Styling:** The `x-status-badge` component may need adjustments or custom alternatives to perfectly match the solid-background badges shown in some reference images for the new light theme.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed or Stated)

*   Utilize Laravel's event/listener system for decoupled notifications and side-effects.
*   Leverage existing controllers and routes where possible (e.g., `JobCommentController` for comments from all user types, resource controller `update` methods for status changes).
*   Maintain clear separation of concerns between Admin, Client, and Freelancer controllers/views.
*   **Standard UI Theme:** A light theme with white content cards, green borders, teal/cyan primary actions and table headers, and specific text/layout conventions (detailed in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`) is the preferred standard for all application views (Admin, Client, Freelancer).

## 6. Learnings & Insights from Current Work

*   The `WorkSubmission` model and its associated processes are central to the platform's core functionality, requiring careful status management and clear UI for different roles.
*   Robust error handling and fallback strategies are needed when automated tools (like file writers) fail.
*   Clear definition of status transitions is crucial for complex workflows.

*This document is the most dynamic and should be updated frequently, ideally at the beginning and end of each development session. It links information from `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to the immediate tasks at hand.*
