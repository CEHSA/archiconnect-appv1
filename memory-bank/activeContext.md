# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

* **What is the immediate task or feature being worked on?**
    * **Job Application Status Update Notifications (Freelancer):**
        * **Goal:** Notify freelancers when an admin updates the status of their job application.
        * **Files Affected/Created:**
            * `app/Events/JobApplicationStatusUpdated.php` (new event, accepts `JobApplication` and optional `oldStatus`).
            * `app/Notifications/JobApplicationStatusUpdatedNotification.php` (new notification class for database and mail).
            * `app/Listeners/NotifyFreelancerOfApplicationStatusUpdate.php` (new listener, handles the event and notifies the freelancer).
            * `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/JobApplicationController.php` (updated `updateStatus` method to dispatch `JobApplicationStatusUpdated` event).
            * `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` (registered the new event and listener).
        * **Outcome:** When an admin changes the status of a job application, an event is dispatched, and a listener sends a notification (database/mail) to the freelancer.
    * **Next Task:** Develop UI for Clients to view applications (if required) and/or implement filters on the admin job applications index page.
* **Previous Work (This Session):**
    * **Admin Job Application Management (Phase 1 - Listing & Viewing):**
        * **Goal:** Allow admins to view submitted job applications.
        * **Files Affected/Created:** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
        * **Outcome:** Admins can list, view, and update status for job applications.
    * **Freelancer Job Application System (Phase 1 - Submission):**
        * **Goal:** Allow freelancers to apply for jobs posted to them.
        * **Files Affected/Created:** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
        * **Outcome:** Freelancers can submit applications; admins are notified.
    * **Notification Logic for `JobPostedToFreelancers` Event:**
        * **Goal:** Implement notification sending for jobs posted to freelancers.
        * **Files Affected:** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
        * **Outcome:** Freelancers receive notifications; UI shows unread counts.
* **Previous Work (Earlier This Session - Admin Job Management & Current Jobs Page):**
    * Admin Manage Jobs Page - Delete Button Fix (Completed).
    * Admin Manage Jobs Page - Filters (status, date, client) (Completed).
    * Current Jobs Page with progress bar logic (Completed).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

* **What significant changes were made recently (This Session)?**
    * **Job Application Status Update Notifications:**
        * Created `JobApplicationStatusUpdated` event and `JobApplicationStatusUpdatedNotification` class.
        * Implemented `NotifyFreelancerOfApplicationStatusUpdate` listener.
        * Updated `AdminJobApplicationController@updateStatus` to dispatch the event.
        * Registered event/listener in `EventServiceProvider`.
        * **Impact:** Freelancers will now be notified when the status of their job application changes.
    * **Admin Job Application Management (Phase 1):** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
    * **Job Application System (Phase 1 - Submission):** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
    * **Notification Logic for `JobPostedToFreelancers`:** (Details in previous `activeContext.md` version)
    * **Tooling Issues:** Continued intermittent failures with file writing tools.

## 3. Next Steps & Pending Tasks

* **Immediate (For Job Application System - Phase 2 & Admin Management Refinement):**
    * Develop UI for Clients (job posters) to view applications if the workflow requires their involvement in selection.
    * Implement filters on the admin job applications index page (`resources/views/admin/job-applications/index.blade.php`).
    * Implement the TODO for notifying the client in `app/Listeners/NotifyAdminOfJobApplication.php`.
    * Update action URLs in `app/Notifications/NewJobApplicationNotification.php` once admin/client application views are finalized.
* **For Admin Job Assignment & Posting Feature (Remaining from previous):**
    * Integrate the "Job Application" system with "Job Assignment". If an application status is set to 'accepted_for_assignment', this should likely trigger the creation or update of a `JobAssignment`.
    * Clarify/merge "Proposals" vs. "Applications".
* **Broader pending tasks:** (As listed in previous `activeContext.md`)

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

* **Application Workflow & Statuses:** The implications of 'accepted_for_assignment' status need to be implemented (e.g., creating a `JobAssignment`).
* **Client Involvement in Application Review:** Decision needed.
* **Tool Stability:** Ongoing concern.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed or Stated)

* Consistent use of Laravel's features.
* Adherence to UI theme.

## 6. Learnings & Insights from Current Work

* Event-driven notifications provide a clean way to handle side effects of actions like status updates.

*This document is the most dynamic and should be updated frequently. It links information from `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to the immediate tasks at hand.*
