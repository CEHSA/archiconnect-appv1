# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

* **What is the immediate task or feature being worked on?**
  * **Begin Phase 1 Implementation: PHPUnit Test Resolution, Messaging UI Enhancements, and Notification URL Review.**
    * **Goal:** Stabilize existing features by fixing critical PHPUnit tests, complete the user-facing aspects of the messaging system, and ensure all notifications are actionable.
* **Previous Work (This Session - leading to current plan):**
  * Review of user roles against memory bank and `workflow.yaml`.
  * Identification of pending implementations per user group.
  * Formulation of a phased implementation plan (Phase 1-4).
  * (Older "Previous Work" items like "Client View for Job Applications", "Messaging System Refactor (Phase 1 Completion & Verification)" are now considered completed prerequisites for the current phased plan).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

* **What significant changes were made recently (This Session)?**
  * **Completed Messaging System Refactor (Phase 1):**
    * Full refactor for group chat, including DB, Model, Controllers.
    * Comprehensive event-listener-notification system for client, admin, and freelancer messages (including approval/rejection flow).
    * Ensured conversation participants are synced on job assignment (including all admins, as confirmed).
    * Updated attachment storage paths and verified URL generation.
    * Applied basic UI enhancements (WhatsApp-like styling, emoji placeholder) to client message view.
    * **Impact:** Core backend for new messaging workflow established and initially verified.
  * **PHPUnit Test Execution:** Ran `tests/Feature/UserRoleInteractionsTest.php` and identified new errors (these are now the first action items in Phase 1).
  * **Adoption of Phased Implementation Plan (5/24/2025):**
    * A multi-phase plan (Phase 1-4) has been adopted to systematically address pending implementations.
    * Decision made to run comprehensive PHPUnit tests after the completion of each phase.
    * **Impact:** Provides a structured approach to development, ensuring stability at each stage.
  * **PHPUnit Test Fixes (UserRoleInteractionsTest.php - 5/24/2025):**
    * Resolved foreign key constraint violations by using correct Admin profile IDs in test setups.
    * Fixed "Attempt to read property 'name' on null" in `FreelancerWorkSubmittedDbNotification` by ensuring correct eager loading (`freelancer` instead of `freelancer.user`) in the `NotifyAdminOfWorkSubmission` listener and by correcting property access in the notification (`$this->workSubmission->freelancer->name`).
    * Addressed "no such column: client_remarks" in `work_submissions` table by creating and applying the necessary database migration.
    * Corrected controller logic in `Freelancer\WorkSubmissionController@store` to update the parent `Job` status to `work_submitted` upon work submission.
    * Modified `Freelancer\WorkSubmissionController@store` to return a 201 JSON response when the request expects JSON, resolving a 302 status mismatch.
    * **Impact:** All tests in `tests/Feature/UserRoleInteractionsTest.php` now pass, improving confidence in related functionalities.
  * (Previous changes detailed in prior `activeContext.md` versions, e.g., Messaging System Refactor Phase 1, are now part of the baseline for this new plan).

## 3. Next Steps & Pending Tasks (Phased Implementation Plan)

* **Phase 1 (Immediate Focus - Stabilization & Core UI Completion):**
  * **PHPUnit Test Resolution (UserRoleInteractionsTest.php - COMPLETED 5/24/2025):**
    * ~~Address `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 19 FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` in `test_client_can_approve_or_request_revisions`.~~ (Resolved)
    * ~~Address `Attempt to read property "name" on null` in `app\Notifications\FreelancerWorkSubmittedDbNotification.php` during `test_freelancer_can_submit_work`.~~ (Resolved, along with subsequent issues like missing column, incorrect job status update, and incorrect JSON response code).
  * **Messaging System UI Enhancements (All Roles):**
    * Implement emoji picker functionality.
    * Apply further styling refinements (e.g., message tails, read receipts if planned).
    * Review and implement UI for Admin message approval/rejection within the Admin's message view.
    * Ensure consistent UI across Client, Freelancer, and Admin message views.
  * **Notification Action URL Review (System-Wide):**
    * Review all existing notifications and update action URLs to ensure they link to the correct and most relevant pages. Create new specific views if a more targeted landing page is needed.
  * ***Post-Phase 1 Milestone: Execute all PHPUnit tests to ensure stability.***

* **Phase 2 (Core Workflow Components):**
  * **Freelancer Time Tracking System (Freelancer, Admin):**
    * Freelancer UI: Start/stop timer, display tracked time, automatic stop function.
    * Backend Logic: `TimeLog` model, `Freelancer\TimeLogController`, utilize `FreelancerTimeLogStarted`/`Stopped` events.
    * Timesheet Submission: Mechanism for freelancers to submit logged hours.
    * Admin View: Interface to view freelancer timesheets/logged hours.
  * **Budget Management & Appeal System (Client, Admin, Freelancer):**
    * Admin: Set initial budget, view status, review/approve appeals, update budget.
    * Freelancer: Submit budget appeal with justification.
    * Client: View budget status, review appeals.
    * System: Store budget info, notifications for appeal lifecycle.
  * ***Post-Phase 2 Milestone: Execute all PHPUnit tests.***

* **Phase 3 (Remaining Workflow Steps & User Management):**
  * **Client Account Registration & Profile Enhancements.**
  * **Admin Project Setup Enhancements (Capture scope, timeline, budget in-system).**
  * **Freelancer Availability Indication System.**
  * **Admin: Functionality to Mark Project as "Completed".**
  * ***Post-Phase 3 Milestone: Execute all PHPUnit tests.***

* **Phase 4 (Payment Processing):**
  * **Payment System Implementation:**
    * Define hourly rate management.
    * Admin interface for payment initiation.
    * Payment gateway integration or manual process support.
    * Client/Freelancer views for payment history/invoices.
    * Payment-related notifications.
  * ***Post-Phase 4 Milestone: Execute all PHPUnit tests.***

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

* **Conversation Context:** How to handle multiple conversation threads for a single Job/Assignment if needed.
* **Real-time Updates:** Future consideration.
* **Foreign Key Constraints:** (Previously noted, largely addressed for `UserRoleInteractionsTest.php`). Continue monitoring during development.
* **Notification Relationships:** (Previously noted, addressed for `FreelancerWorkSubmittedDbNotification`). Continue monitoring.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed or Stated)

* Event-driven notifications.
* WhatsApp-style messaging.
* Specific folder structure for attachments.
* Standard Light Theme UI/UX conventions.
* Defensive Eager Loading & Data Validation in Controllers.
* **Iterative Phased Implementation with Post-Phase Testing:** Adopted strategy to implement features in logical phases, followed by comprehensive PHPUnit testing at the end of each phase to ensure stability before proceeding.

## 6. Learnings & Insights from Current Work

* Refactoring core systems like messaging has wide-ranging impacts.
* Clear definition of participant roles and notification flows is key for group chat.
* Ensuring all user types (Client, Freelancer, Admin) have appropriate message handling logic in their respective controllers is crucial.
* Tooling instability requires fallback strategies (e.g., using `write_to_file` when `replace_in_file` fails).
* Thorough testing reveals subtle data integrity and relationship loading issues, and is critical for validating fixes. Iterative testing after each small change is beneficial.
